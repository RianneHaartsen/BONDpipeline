# BONDpipeline
The BOND pipeline was developed for pre-processing of EEG power and connectivity and is based on the MADE pipeline. 

This pipeline is based on the Maryland Analysis of Developmental EEG (MADE) pipeline with small adjustments to make it suitable for the Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) dataset and analyses of EEG connectivity. EEG power and connectivity metrics from the BOND pipeline were compared with metrics calculated after pre-processing with a manual pipeline, the MADE pipeline, and the Harvard Automated Processing Pipeline for EEG.
